# movies
This webpage provides the user with a random movie and dinner suggestion.

From a dropdown choice user can choose a genre and click the submit button. Then user will be provided with a random movie and food selection. The webpage will show a movie poster, movie info (title, actors, plot, rating), and a food image.

Previously suggested movie titles are saved to the local storage and shown at the bottom of the page. The title history can be cleared with a clear button.

The style is based on Bulma.
